## Configuration files

## Installation drivers for Logitech Racing wheels
Most of the Logitech Racing wheels are not supported in Linux (with the exception of the Logitech G29).
Fortunatelly, 'new-lg4ff' is a custom driver that you can install and which will support most of the FFB effects too.
More information at https://github.com/berarma/new-lg4ff.
